# NeuroForge Development Completed Successfully! 🎉

## What We Built

NeuroForge is now a fully functional AI-powered memory and task automation system for VS Code, consisting of:

### 🏗️ Core Architecture
- **Python Backend**: Memory engine with LMDB storage and task automation system
- **TypeScript Extension**: VS Code integration with webviews and command palette
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom task automation
- **Git Integration**: Smart commit analysis and automated workflows
